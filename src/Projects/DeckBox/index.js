               better.
               - Deck boxes are not just a storage device for organizing and protecting cards, but
               it is also a game piece and an outlet for self expression. Of those three,
               functionality is the most important. A box that can’t protect the cards, or worse
               damages them, is dead on arrival.
               - Different players have vastly different needs for their boxes so there exist many
               different types, though the most in demand are Commander deck boxes.`,
